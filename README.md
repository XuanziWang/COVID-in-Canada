# COVID-in-Canada
In this project, our team was tasked with understanding the
discourse surrounding COVID-19 in Canadian social media,
and in particular, hesitancy surrounding vaccines. Our main
goals with this project were to uncover: the main topics discussed regarding COVID and how people are engaging with
these topics with respect to if the response is generally positive, negative or neutral with respect to these topics.
